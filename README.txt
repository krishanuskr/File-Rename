This python file was designed to remove the 'y2mate.com - ' substring from all the files which begin with that substring in a given directory.
Video files which are downloaded from YouTube using the y2mate service have this substring ahead of the name of the file.

Run the python file after changing the path of the directory (hardcoded).

Enjoy!
